# Burger
## MySQL Burger application

## Sequelize-Burger
I created a burger logger app with Sequelize, Node, Express, Handlebars and a Sequelize's ORM methods. I followed the MVC design pattern; used Node and Sequelize to query and route data in my app, and Handlebars to generated my HTML.

### How it works
Mondo Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, my app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be eaten.
